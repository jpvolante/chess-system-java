Chess System in Java

This project was developed to exercise learning the Java programming language and to practice backend development in a fun and engaging way by creating a chess game. The project was developed in conjunction with the "Java Completo" course, offered by Professor NÃ©lio Alves.

Implementation of basic chess rules
Movements of all pieces (king, queen, bishop, knight, rook, and pawn)
Validation of legal and illegal moves
Simple console interface for playing

The main goal is to apply object-oriented programming concepts in Java, while developing programming logic and strategic thinking through the implementation of a chess game.
